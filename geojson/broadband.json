This project will complete the required environmental assessment work on the proposed tower site.  Once the environmental assessment is completed, the partners will be able to move forward with plans to relocate an existing tower that provides very limited coverage, and due to its use of solar power is susceptible to failure with heavy use and on cloudy days.  The new site will have power, provided by Holy Cross, and will provide the needed coverage in the area.",
